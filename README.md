## Project title
Kickstarter Analysis - Module 1 Challenge

## General info
The purpose of this project is to analyze how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. In order to analyze this collection of data, we were asked to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Technologies
Microsoft Excel for Microsoft 365 MSO

## Analysis and challenges
### Overview ###
On this sheet which is created with eight columns and twelve rows—students were asked to use different formulas and chart/table functions to analyze the relationships and correlations between data sets, and also to identify patterns and trends for interpretation. e.g., by using the ‘PivotTable’ function, students were able to create a chart (labeled “category Statistics”):

From this chart, one can analyze the relationships and correlations between the number of “successful”, “live”, “failed”, “canceled” outcomes and the “Category.” It is fair to conclude that among the “Category,” “Theatre” has the largest number of the “successful” outcomes in this given data.

           <p>The only “challenge” that I encountered was that the instructions in modules only show one way of doing a certain task, to get the results (as in having correct numbers in cells). I have used different formulas and got the same results, but I had to go back and change since it had a different formula on modules, as if that were the only way to calculate that given dataset. However, overall, it was a good practice to see how others would get the set up a formula or use different functions in Excel to solve problems. </p>
