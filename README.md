# On this sheet which is created with eight columns and twelve rows—students were asked to use different formulas and chart/table functions to analyze the relationships and correlations between data sets, and also to identify patterns and trends for interpretation. e.g., by using the ‘PivotTable’ function, students were able to create a chart (labeled “category Statistics”):
 ![](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
#From this chart, one can analyze the relationships and correlations between the number of “successful”, “live”, “failed”, “canceled” outcomes and the “Category.” It is fair to conclude that among the “Category,” “Theatre” has the largest number of the “successful” outcomes in this given data.
